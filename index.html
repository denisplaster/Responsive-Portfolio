                With more then 15 years of experience as a professional photographer, 
                Denis still feels the passion and excitement of documenting a couple's most special day. 
                Denis' aptitude for staging, as well as putting people at ease, is one of his greatest traits. 
                He is particularly proficient at candid shots of people or improvisational photographs. 
                His photographic journey started at an early age with film equipment and then progressed to the digital environment. 
                He is a “master photographer” who captures not only the beauty and uniqueness of every couple's celebrated occasion, 
                but also the small details and moments that might otherwise be missed. Denis resides in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
